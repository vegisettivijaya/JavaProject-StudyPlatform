This is a Java-based application that helps users enroll in online courses from different platforms. It allows users to choose courses like Programming, Web Development, Aptitude, and Data Structures and select their preferred learning mode (Live Classes, Video Lectures, or Mock Tests).

Key Features:

Course & Mode Selection: Users can pick courses and learning modes based on their preferences.

Seat Management: Tracks available seats for Live Classes, Video Lectures, and Mock Tests, ensuring no overbooking.

Pricing & Discounts: Calculates total subscription cost based on course, mode, and duration (6 months or 1 year) and applies discounts using coupons.

Enrollment Records: Saves course selections, prices, and discounts in a text file, allowing users to keep a record.

Existing Enrollments: Reads from a file to update seat availability when a user enrolls.

This project showcases Java's real-world applications, including file handling, pricing logic, and seat management, all through a simple command-line interface for easy interaction.
